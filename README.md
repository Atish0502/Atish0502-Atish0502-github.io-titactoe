JUST A SIMPLE TICTACTOE GAME,
where one chooses x whereas other chooses O now both alternatively draw their choices on tictactoe board,
one with the same choices acroos a line or diagonal wins ,other looses, we can upgrade the gameby:
:giving other symbols for x and o
:creating a points table for the nuber of times player chooses to play before they win
:online play with other devices
but thats a lot of way to go, so we need to learn more

the rules are same as normal tictactoe game.
